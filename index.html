            <h2>Notes, Reminders, and Ideas</h2>
            <p>📌Add Webfontloader to this website so I can add a prefferable font that I like to look at to the
                website.❌</p>
            <p>📌Add Handlebars, Vue, or React to this website to make it a multi page application (Vue or Handlebars is
                the preffered). ❌</p>
            <p>📌Add a page for the schedule Archive ❌</p>
            <p>📌Add a page for links to all of my educational websites. Trailhead, ZTM, Google docs, calendar,
                Linkedin, Resumes, etc.❌</p>
            <p>📌Add a MySQL database to archive schedules and notes. Add ability to create notes and edit schedules
                with this feature. ❌</p>
            <p>📌Add the ability to be able to toggle things as either complete or incomplete (also as a bonus, send
                completed tasks to the archive once they are toggled as complete) ❌</p>
            <p>📌Add a scrum class to furthered courses ❌</p>
            <p>📌Add a learning environment for all the Jargon in tech so I can learn what people are talking about ❌
            </p>
            <p>📌Add an agile methodology course ❌</p>
            <p>📌Add a public speaking class ❌</p>
            <p>📌Look into starting trading classes again with Chart Champions and add that to the curriculum ❌</p>
            <p>📌Apply for some jobs with CivicPlus? ❌</p>
            <p>📌Look into trading classes through Chart Champions. Add a spot for the courses in this website. ❌</p>
            <p>📌Add a section in my planning application that better organizes my google documents. As of now they are
                ridiculous and difficult to see whats what. Google Drive offers a solution but I want a better one for
                myself. Generate a page where I can more easily access my google documents. ❌</p>
            <p>📌Add a login ability to my education application. This will help protect the data. NOTE: Hard-coding
                everything every week will be a helpful tool to protect everything on Github as well as on my machine,
                locally. A weekly/bi-weekly backup may be warranted.❌</p>
