        <ul>
            <li>Add Webfontloader to this website so I can add a prefferable font that I like to look at to the
                website. ❌</li>
            <li>Add a page for links to all of my educational websites. Trailhead, ZTM, Google docs, calendar,
                Linkedin, Resumes, etc. ❌</li>
            <li>Add a MySQL OR Firebase database to archive schedules and notes. Add ability to create notes and edit
                schedules
                with this feature. ❌</li>
            <li>Add the ability to be able to toggle things as either complete or incomplete (also as a bonus, send
                completed tasks to the archive once they are toggled as complete) ❌</li>
            <li>Add a scrum class to furthered courses ❌</li>
            <li>Add a learning environment for all the Jargon in tech so I can learn what people are talking about ❌
            </li>
            <li>Add an agile methodology course ❌</li>
            <li>Add a public speaking class ❌</li>
            <li>Apply for some jobs with CivicPlus? ❌</li>
            <li>Add a section in my planning application that better organizes my google documents. As of now they are
                ridiculous and difficult to see whats what. Google Drive offers a solution but I want a better one for
                myself. Generate a page where I can more easily access my google documents. ❌</li>
            <li>Add a 'login' ability to my education application. This will help protect the data. NOTE: Hard-coding
                everything every week will be a helpful tool to protect everything on Github as well as on my machine,
                locally. A weekly/bi-weekly backup may be warranted.❌</li>
            <li>Add a reading list to the education application ❌</li>
            <li>Add some switching ability to the Home page of the education planner. Allow myself to be able to toggle
                between the different education paths, or see them all at once. ❌</li>
            <li>Add Tailwind to this project to get some better looking CSS going forward ❌</li>
            <li>Add Firebase to the project to save archived notes and schedules. ❌</li>
            <li>Give this website a rules for life section ❌</li>
            <!-- <li>❌</li> -->
            <!-- <li>❌</li> -->
            <!-- <li>❌</li> -->
            <!-- <li>❌</li> -->
            <!-- <li>❌</li> -->
            <!-- <li>❌</li> -->
            <!-- <li>❌</li> -->
