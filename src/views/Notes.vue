        <h2>Active Notes, Reminders, and Ideas</h2>
        <p>📌Add Webfontloader to this website so I can add a prefferable font that I like to look at to the
            website.❌</p>
        <p>📌Add a page for links to all of my educational websites. Trailhead, ZTM, Google docs, calendar,
            Linkedin, Resumes, etc.❌</p>
        <p>📌Add a MySQL OR Firebase database to archive schedules and notes. Add ability to create notes and edit schedules
            with this feature. ❌</p>
        <p>📌Add the ability to be able to toggle things as either complete or incomplete (also as a bonus, send
            completed tasks to the archive once they are toggled as complete) ❌</p>
        <p>📌Add a scrum class to furthered courses ❌</p>
        <p>📌Add a learning environment for all the Jargon in tech so I can learn what people are talking about ❌
        </p>
        <p>📌Add an agile methodology course ❌</p>
        <p>📌Add a public speaking class ❌</p>
        <p>📌Apply for some jobs with CivicPlus? ❌</p>
        <p>📌Add a section in my planning application that better organizes my google documents. As of now they are
            ridiculous and difficult to see whats what. Google Drive offers a solution but I want a better one for
            myself. Generate a page where I can more easily access my google documents. ❌</p>
        <p>📌Add a 'login' ability to my education application. This will help protect the data. NOTE: Hard-coding
            everything every week will be a helpful tool to protect everything on Github as well as on my machine,
            locally. A weekly/bi-weekly backup may be warranted.❌</p>
        <p>📌Add a reading list to the education application ❌</p>
        <p>📌Add somt switching ability to the Home page of the education planner. Allow myself to be able to toggle between the different education paths, or see them all at once. ❌</p>
