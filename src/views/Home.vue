      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>This is my 2023 weekly planner. The courses I am going to take are outlined below, in order. A
        combination of ZTM and and Trailhead courses are listed along with other goals and educational
        opportunities, to be updated soon with more content, and with a better UI. The weekly schedule below will be updated every Friday to reflect the schedule for the
        next week, starting on Saturday and ending on Friday. Uncompleted goals for each educational path below
        will have a ❌ emoji, and finished paths will have a ✔️ emoji. Let's get this bread! 🍞</p>
